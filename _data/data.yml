    title: Career Summary
    summary: |
      
      I am naturally drawn to the big picture - the "why" and the "so what" and the "how might we" - and at the same time driven to develop a deep understanding of the specializations required to achieve the desired big picture outcomes. I shift as needed from being a generalist, crossing organizational and functional boundaries to see how everything fits together, to being a specialist, working deep in the self-contained silos that make up the parts of the whole. My favorite projects are the ones in which I start out having no idea how I will complete them or how they will actually turn out and for which I am, in a traditional sense, generally unprepared to tackle.
